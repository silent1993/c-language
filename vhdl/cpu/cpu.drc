WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   element6/Mtrien_DBUS<0>_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net element3/reg_0_not0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net element3/reg_1_cmp_eq0000
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net element3/reg_2_cmp_eq0000
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
