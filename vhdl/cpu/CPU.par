   "CPU" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s500e, package pq208, speed -4

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.320 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.27 2012-12-04".

Phase 4.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

....................
WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB /
   clock site pair. The clock component <RST_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X1Y1>. The IO component <RST> is
   placed at site <IPAD175>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <RST.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override
   is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be
   corrected in the design.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
